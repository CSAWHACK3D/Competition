The Mystery of the Lost Brick:

Team Hack3D has been trying to determine the amount of stress that is exerted on a 4x2 brick when an adult accidentally steps onto it. The team has been working all week long to create the CAD file of the brick and running the simulation study on it. The team has saved their work to a shared Google Drive folder. On 10/31/2020, the unexpected happenedâ€¦
When the head engineer tried to access the shared folder, all of their saved files were missing and there were only two files that can be found in the folder. The CAD and all of the simulation data have been replaced. A cybersecurity breach? Or an awful Halloween office prank?
Your reverse engineering team has been asked to help in this case of the missing file set for a very important experiment. Team Hack3D have asked you to try to retrieve the original CAD and simulation results data. Here is what is requested of you:

The WRL (or VRML) file left behind in the folder contains missing CAD features. The bottom of the brick is missing its interior features. Your first task is to modify/re-create the 4x2 brick to allow for multiple instances to be able to connect and stack on top of each other. Your team will need to reverse engineer the file to get back the original CAD. 
Your team needs to determine the maximum stress (value and unit) of the simulation of the brick from the files. The maximum stress is the most important parameter of this simulation and your team must find a way to retrieve it back from the given data.
