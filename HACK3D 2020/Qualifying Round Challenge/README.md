Hello Red Team,

You are an employee in the cybersecurity R&D department. The director has created a new project of designing a security protocol to protect the company’s engineering design information. A Blue team was formed to develop the security protocol and your Red team was tasked with testing the robustness of the protocol and reporting any flaws. 
The Blue team is challenging you by obfuscating a CAD model from the company’s products. The director of the company has asked your team to decode or reverse engineer the part. The only other information available about the part is that it weighs 19.7 g. You and your Red team will work to report all the steps required to reproduce the CAD model design file again.
